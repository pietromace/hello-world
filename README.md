# hello-world
My first repository
Dear folks:

I'm a begginer at this new world. I'm Mechanical Engineer and I'm doing an Master in Big Data.
I created this account so I can keep in touch with all updates, learn how to code and, maybe, help other with my future knowledge.

Hope to learn a lot here!

Thanks.

BR,
Pietro Macedo.
